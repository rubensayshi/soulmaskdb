# Spawn Extraction — Results & Implementation Notes

## What was built

`pipeline/parse_spawns_run.ps1` — PowerShell pipeline that extracts spawn coordinates from
Soulmask `.umap` level files using UAssetGUI CLI, producing `Game/Parsed/spawns.json`.

## Output: `Game/Parsed/spawns.json`

**6,832 spawn points, 6,832/6,832 with X/Y/Z world coordinates.**

Each entry:
```json
{
  "map": "Level01_GamePlay",
  "map_path": "Level01\\Level01_Hub\\Level01_GamePlay.umap",
  "spawner_class": "HShuaGuaiQiBase",
  "actor_name": "SGQ_BaoZi_ShenMi_Event",
  "pos_x": 239190.0,
  "pos_y": -43900.0,
  "pos_z": 43720.0,
  "rotation_yaw": 0.0
}
```

Coordinates are UE4 world-space (centimeters from origin). `rotation_yaw` present when non-default.

### By map

| Map | Spawners | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Level01_GamePlay` | 5,364 | Main open-world spawners (Cloud Mist Forest) |
| `Level01_GamePlay2` | 768 | Second open-world gameplay layer |
| `Level01_GamePlay3` | 470 | Third open-world gameplay layer |
| DiXiaCheng dungeon rooms | 201 | Underground city (checkpoints, boss rooms, corridors) |
| ZhanChang01 battlefield | 26 | PvE battlefield arena |
| Level01 ruins / YiJi | 3 | Open-world dungeon entrances |

### By spawner class

| Class | Count | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HShuaGuaiQiBase` | 3,631 | Standard animal/creature spawner |
| `BP_HShuaGuaiQiRandNPC_C` | 2,763 | Random NPC group spawner |
| `HShuaGuaiQiDiXiaCheng` | 227 | Underground city encounter spawner |
| `BP_HShuaGuaiQi_ShouLong_C` | 90 | Dragon spawner |
| `BP_HShuaGuaiQi_JuanShe_C` | 46 | Boa constrictor spawner |
| `HShuaGuaiVolumeChuFaQi` | 25 | Volume trigger spawner |
| `BP_RuQinSGQ_C` | 23 | Invasion/event spawner |
| `BP_HShuaGuaiQi_TuoNiao_C` | 10 | Ostrich spawner |
| `BP_HShuaGuaiQi_JiaoDiao_Egg_C` | 7 | Eagle egg spawner |

## How it works

### Step 1 — Binary scan
All 286 `.umap` files in `Content/Maps/` are scanned for the byte strings `ShuaGuaiQi`
and `BP_SGQ` to identify which files contain spawner actors (FName table hit).
50 files matched; dev/test maps and `Level01_Main` are excluded from processing (see below).

### Step 2 — Export to JSON
Each matching `.umap` is exported to JSON using:
```
UAssetGUI.exe tojson <file.umap> <out.json> VER_UE4_27
```

### Step 3 — Parse spawner actors
For each export in the JSON:
1. Resolve `ClassIndex` → Import table → check if class name contains `ShuaGuaiQi`/`SGQ`
2. Follow `RootComponent` property → export index → read `RelativeLocation`
3. `RelativeLocation` in UAssetAPI JSON: `Value[0].Value` = `FVector { X, Y, Z }`

Key non-obvious detail: `RelativeLocation` is a `StructProperty(Vector)` whose `Value` array
contains a single `VectorPropertyData` whose own `Value` is an `FVector` object. Not a
flat `{X, Y, Z}` struct — there's one extra level of wrapping.

## Known gaps

### Level01_Main.umap (998 MB) — OOM on export
UAssetGUI loads the entire file into a .NET object tree before writing JSON. The estimated
JSON output (~14 GB, based on the 14× expansion ratio from smaller files) exceeds available
RAM even on 32 GB systems.

**What it probably contains:** Landscape heightmaps, terrain components, foliage instances,
lighting — not spawner actors. The spawner actors for the open world appear to be in the
`Level01_GamePlay*.umap` sublevels (confirmed: 6,602 spawners extracted from those alone).

**Fix options if needed:**
- Write a custom UE4 binary parser that reads only the FName/Import/Export tables + seeks
  to individual export data blocks (avoiding loading the full file). The export table has
  `SerialOffset` + `SerialSize` per export, enabling surgical reads.
- Use UAssetAPI as a .NET assembly loaded directly into PowerShell, with streaming output.
- Cross-validate the extracted count against saraserenity.net's reference data (52 MB JSON
  with spawn coordinates). If counts match, the Main gap is not material.

### Level02 (Shifting Sands DLC) — 0 spawners found
`Level02_Main.umap` (498 MB) exported successfully to 700 MB JSON but contained 0 spawner
actors. The DLC spawners are likely in separate GamePlay sublevels not yet identified.
Worth running the binary scan on `Level02/` specifically to find the right sublevels.

### `spawner_class` → creature mapping not yet done
`spawner_class` (e.g. `HShuaGuaiQiBase`) is a generic base class. The actual creature type
comes from the spawner's `SCGClass` property → resolves to a blueprint like `BP_DongWu_Eyu_C`.
That join hasn't been wired up yet — `SCGClass` is captured in the blueprint blueprints under
`uasset_export/Blueprints/ShuaGuaiQi/` but not yet parsed.

## World map texture

`Content/UI/Map/Level01_Map.uasset` — **29.8 MB** — the full world map texture used in-game.
Single file, no tiles to stitch. Also in that folder:

| File | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `UI/Map/Level01_Map.uasset` | 29.8 MB | World map texture (Cloud Mist Forest) |
| `UI/Map/DATA_Level01Height.uasset` | 8 MB | Heightmap data |
| `UI/Map/RT_WorldMapHeight.uasset` | ~0 | Render target (no content) |
| `UI/Map/BP_WorldMapDepth_Capture.uasset` | 0.07 MB | Capture blueprint |

**Extraction:** UAssetGUI cannot export textures (it only handles blueprints/datatables).
Use **FModel** to extract the texture as PNG:
1. Open FModel, point at the game's `.pak` files or the modkit content
2. Navigate to `Game/UI/Map/Level01_Map`
3. Export as PNG

No Level02 (Shifting Sands) equivalent was found under a similar name — may be stored
differently or not yet in the modkit.
